# Monument-detection-VGG16
The "Indian monument detection using CNN (VGG16)" project is a machine learning project that involves using a supervised learning algorithm, specifically the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN), to identify Indian monuments in images.

VGG16 is a pre-trained CNN that was developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. It has been trained on a large dataset of images and can be used to classify images into various categories.

In this project, the goal would be to use VGG16 to classify images of Indian monuments. To do this, a dataset of images of Indian monuments would need to be prepared and labeled with the names of the monuments. This dataset would be used to train the VGG16 model to recognize Indian monuments.

Once the model has been trained on this dataset, it can then be used to classify new images as containing an Indian monument or not. This could be useful for various applications, such as automatically generating tags for images on a photo sharing website or creating a virtual tour of Indian monuments.

The use of a pre-trained CNN such as VGG16 allows for a relatively straightforward and efficient process for monument detection, as the model has already been trained on a large dataset and can be fine-tuned for the specific task of detecting Indian monuments.
